## Task Descriptions

### 1. PRODIGY_ML_01_Sales_Prediction

**Objective:** Predict future sales based on historical sales data.

**Description:** This task involves creating a predictive model to forecast sales figures. You will work with time-series data or historical sales records to train a model that can make accurate predictions. Techniques may include regression analysis, time-series forecasting, and other predictive algorithms.

**Key Features:**
- Historical sales data preprocessing
  
- Feature engineering for time-series data
  
- Model training and evaluation

### 2. PRODIGY_ML_02_Clustering_Mall_Customers

**Objective:** Group customers into clusters based on their purchasing behavior.

**Description:** This task focuses on customer segmentation using clustering algorithms. By analyzing customer data, you can identify distinct groups or segments based on features such as spending habits and visit frequency. Techniques may include K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and other unsupervised learning methods.

**Key Features:**

-Data preprocessing and normalization

-Application of clustering algorithms

-Visualization of clusters and insights

### 3. PRODIGY_ML_03_Image_Classification

**Objective:** Classify images into predefined categories.

**Description:** This task involves building a model to classify images into different categories. You'll work with image data, apply image processing techniques, and train a classification model. Common approaches include using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other deep learning architectures.

**Key Features:**

-Image data preprocessing

-Application of CNNs for image classification

-Model evaluation and performance metrics



### 4. PRODIGY_ML_04_CNN_Hand_Gesture_Recognition

**Objective:** Recognize hand gestures from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

**Description:** This task involves building a model to recognize different hand gestures from images. It leverages CNNs to extract features and classify hand gestures into categories. The goal is to develop a robust model that can accurately identify various gestures in real-time.

**Key Features:**

-Hand gesture dataset preparation
